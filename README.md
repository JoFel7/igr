# Project Title: Game Review Website

## Description
This project is a website where users can search for video games from a database and write reviews for those games. It also provides a section for game creators and allows the inclusion of images.

## Prerequisites
Before you start building the project, you'll need the following:

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- A database system (e.g., MongoDB, MySQL) set up to store game information and reviews.
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for frontend development.
- Express.js for building the backend.
- A web framework or library like React, Angular, or Vue for the frontend.
- A server for hosting the website (e.g., Heroku, AWS).

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the project repository to your local machine:git clone https://github.com/your-username/game-review-website.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:cd game-review-website

3. Install the required dependencies for both the frontend and backend:
cd client
npm install
cd ../server
npm install

4. Set up your database connection in the server configuration.

5. Start both the frontend and backend servers:
Inside the 'client' directory
npm start

Inside the 'server' directory
npm start

6. Access the website by opening your browser and navigating to http://localhost:3000 (or the port you configured).

## Features
- **Game Database**: Thousands of games are stored in the database.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for games by name, genre, platform, etc.
- **Game Details Page**: Clicking on a game displays detailed information, including images, description, and reviews.
- **User Registration and Authentication**: Users can register, log in, and write reviews. User authentication is required to submit reviews.
- **Review System**: Users can rate games and write reviews. Reviews can include text and images.
- **Creator Section**: A dedicated section for game creators to add and manage their games.
- **Admin Panel**: Admins can manage users, games, and reviews.

## Deployment
To make the website accessible to the public, you'll need to deploy it to a web server. Popular hosting options include Heroku, AWS, and Vercel.
